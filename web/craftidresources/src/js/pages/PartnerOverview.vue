                <p>Welcome to Craft Partners. Here is where you will manage your
                    <router-link to="profile">Partner profile</router-link>.</p>

                <p>We ask that you completely populate your profile with all
                    relevant information. While in this Beta state you won’t be
                    able to see how your profile will look on the live site,
                    however, once Craft Partners goes live later this month, you
                    will be able to continue to edit all of the information
                    (other than the website slug) in your profile, whenever
                    you’d like. We encourage Partners to continually add new
                    projects to their gallery and ensure that their profile’s
                    information is current.</p>

                <p>Following the launch of Craft Partners, we will begin the
                    Verification process. Once you've been verified we will
                    add the corresponding verified badge to your profile.</p>

                <p>All Partners will receive the Craft Partner badge that you
                    can add to your own website and marketing materials prior
                    to launch. Verified badges will be sent out once the Partner
                    has been verified.</p>

                <p>If you have any questions, please contact us at
                    <a href="mailto:partners@craftcms.com">partners@craftcms.com</a>.</p>
